- 👋 Hi, we are the Hermann Meyer KG from Germany.
- 👀 We are a trading company with a focus for garden, landscaping and tree nursery equipment.
- 🌱 Together we are about 150 employees all over Germany. Our history goes back over 200 years until the funding in 1819 as a plant pot shop in Rellingen, northern Germany, where our headquarter is still located. We are still family owned and family driven.
- 💞️ This is a corporate account mainly for funding our open source tech stack. But feel free for reaching out to us if you have questions or if you are interested in joining us.
- 📫 Our homepage can be reached via our [Shop.](https://www.meyer-shop.com/)

- ⚡ When implementing new services and applications we use React/TS in the Sharepoint Framework as web frontend and rust as backend services.
